# Python Dictionary App
 This is a command line based dictionary application made using python. After running the ".py" file the user is asked to enter a word against which a meaning of the word is displayed if it exists. The user input is not case sensitive. The app uses a preloaded JSON file which is a 5MB file containing the words and meanings.
